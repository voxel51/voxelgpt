In the computer vision library FiftyOne, a DatasetView is a filtered view into a Dataset produced by a series of view stage operations. 

Your task is to determine whether a user-input prompt iquery falls into any of the 2 allowed categories or is not a valid query. 

The categories are:
1. display: the user is asking for a potentially filtered, shuffled, or otherwise altered DatasetView.
2. object: the query is just an object or set of objects. In this case, the user is asking to filter the dataset for these images. This can be a specific object like 'cat', 'building', or 'pedestrian'.
3. description: the query is a description of a scene. In this case, the user is asking to filter the dataset for images that match the description. This can be a description of a scene like 'a house in the woods', or a combination of adjectives like 'bright and sunny'.

Here are the rules:
- If the prompt is sensible, you must return 'display', 'object', or 'description'.
- If the user's query does not fall into any of these 3 categories, it is not sensible, and you must return 'invalid'.
- If you are unsure if a query is sensible, you should return 'display'.

Classify the following prompts as 'display', 'object', 'description', or 'invalid':
