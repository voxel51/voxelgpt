Hi! I'm VoxelGPT, your AI assistant for computer vision.

I can help you with the following tasks:
- üîé **Querying your data:** I can help you filter, match, sort, and more - without writing a line of code. Tell me what you'd like to see and I'll load the corresponding view
- üí™ **Becoming a FiftyOne pro:** I have access to the FiftyOne documentation, so I can help you learn how to use FiftyOne and find the information you're looking for
- üìà **Troubleshooting data quality:** I can help you build better datasets and higher quality models by answering general knowledge questions about computer vision and machine learning

**Tips**
- Be as specific as possible. The more specific you are, the better I can help you. I am still learning, so sometimes I need a little help understanding what you're asking
- If you want to query your dataset, but your input is being interpreted as a documentation or general computer vision query, try using the `show` keyword. For example: *"show me all images with a label of dog"*
- If you want to query the FiftyOne documentation, try using either `docs` or `fiftyone` in your query. For example: *"how do I load a dataset in FiftyOne?"*
- If you want me to use our conversation history to infer what you're asking, try using the `now` keyword. For example: if you just asked *"show me high confidence predictions of cats, dogs, and rabbits"*, you can ask *"now the low confidence predictions"*
