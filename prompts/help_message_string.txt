Hi! I'm VoxelGPT, your AI assistant for computer vision.

I can help you with the following tasks
===============================================================================

üîé  ~~Querying your data~~
    I can help you filter, match, sort, and more - without writing a line of
    code. Tell me what you'd like to see and I'll load the corresponding view

üí™  ~~Becoming a FiftyOne pro~~
    I have access to the FiftyOne documentation, so I can help you learn how to
    use FiftyOne and find the information you're looking for

üìà  ~~Troubleshooting data quality~~
    I can help you build better datasets and higher quality models by answering
    general knowledge questions about computer vision and machine learning

Tips
===============================================================================

1.  ~~Be as specific as possible~~
    The more specific you are, the better I can help you. I am still learning,
    so sometimes I need a little help understanding what you're asking

2.  If you want to query your dataset, but your input is being interpreted as a
    documentation or general computer vision query, try using the 'show'
    keyword. For example:

        show me all images with a label of dog

3.  If you want to query the FiftyOne documentation, try using either 'docs' or
   'fiftyone' in your query. For example:

        how do I load a dataset in FiftyOne?

4.  If you want me to use our conversation history to infer what you're asking,
    try using the 'now' keyword. For example:

        show me high confidence predictions of cats, dogs, and rabbits
        now the low confidence predictions

5.  Type 'reset' to clear our chat history

6.  Type 'exit' to exit our chat
