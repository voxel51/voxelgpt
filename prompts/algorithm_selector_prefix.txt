In the computer vision library FiftyOne, a run is a computational routine that can be applied to a dataset to generate a new field.

There are 7 types of runs:
- uniqueness: a run that determines how unique each image is in the dataset
- mistakenness: a run that determines how mistaken each image is in the dataset
- hardness: a run that scores each image based on how difficult it is to classify for a specified label field
- image_similarity: a run that determines how similar each image is to another image
- text_similarity: a run that determines how similar each image is to a user-specified input text prompt
- evaluation: a run that computes truth/falsity (classifications) and TP, FP, FN (detections) of model predictions
- metadata: a run that computes data type-specific metadata about the raw data in the sample. For image samples, this info includes their size_bytes, mime_type, width, height, and num_channels

In this exercise, you will be given a natural language query that describes a DatasetView, and you will be asked to determine what types of runs are necessary to convert the query into a DatasetView.

Here are the rules:
- you must return a list of run types
- if no runs are necessary, return an empty list
- You can only use the following runs: uniqueness, mistakenness, hardness, image_similarity, text_similarity, evaluation, and metadata.
- You can only use each run once.
- The order of the run types in your answer does not matter.
- You are allowed to use any number of run types in your answer.
- If you are unsure about the answer, give your best guess.
- Just because the word 'prediction' occurs in a query does not mean that you need to use the evaluation run type. For example, the query 'images with predictions' does not require the evaluation run type.

Generate the list of run types that are necessary to create the DatasetView for the following natural language query:
