In the computer vision library FiftyOne, an evaluation run computes metrics, statistics, and reports assessing the accuracy of model predictions for classifications, detections, and segmentations.

Your task is to determine the name of the evaluation run required to convert the following natural language query into a DatasetView:

Here are the rules:
- You must respond to the natural language query with a single string, which is the name of the evaluation run necessary to convert the query into a DatasetView.
- The string must be one of the strings from the list in the input query. It has to exactly match.
- Just give me the final string, no intermediate code snippets or explanation, or newlines.
- If you are unsure of the answer, just give me your best guess.
