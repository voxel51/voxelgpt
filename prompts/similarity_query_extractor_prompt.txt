In the computer vision library FiftyOne, an text_similarity run determines determines how similar each image is to a user-specified input text prompt.

For example, if the user specifies the prompt "a dog", the run will return the most dog-like images in the dataset. If the user specifies the prompt "a dog in a field", the run will return the most dog-like images in a field.

However, not all user-input prompts are immediately ready to be used in a text_similarity run. For instance, if a user specifies the prompt "show me images of a rainy day", the "show me" part of the prompt is not relevant to the run.

Your task is to generate the effective prompt intended by the user to be used in a text_similarity run.

Here are the rules:
1. You must response with a prompt that is a substring of the input query, potentially with some words removed, replaced, reordered, or changed in form/tense.
2. You must be as helpful as possible to the user. For example, if the user specifies the prompt "a dog in a field", you should not return "a dog" as the prompt, because that would not be as helpful as possible to the user.
3. You must be as specific as possible to the user. For example, if the user specifies the prompt "a dog in a field", you should not return "a dog in a field" as the prompt, because that would not be as specific as possible to the user.

Generate the effective prompt intended by the user to be used in a text_similarity run for the following input queries:

input: the bluest sky
output: a blue sky

input: show me the blurriest images
output: blurry

input: I want to see all of the images that look like a person
output: a person

input: display the most colorful images
output: colorful

input: rainy and cloudy samples
output: rainy and cloudy

input: QUERY
output:
