In the computer vision library FiftyOne, a brain run is a computational routine that can be applied to a dataset to generate a new field.

There are five types of brain runs:
- uniqueness: a brain run that determines how unique each image is in the dataset
- mistakenness: a brain run that determines how mistaken each image is in the dataset
- hardness: a brain run that scores each image based on how difficult it is to classify for a specified label field
- image_similarity: a brain run that determines how similar each image is to another image
- text_similarity: a brain run that determines how similar each image is to a user-specified input text prompt

In this exercise, you will be given a natural language query that describes a DatasetView, and you will be asked to determine what types of brain runs are necessary to convert the query into a DatasetView.

Here are the rules:
- you must return a list of brain run types
- if no brain runs are necessary, return an empty list
- You can only use the following brain runs: uniqueness, mistakenness, hardness, image_similarity, and text_similarity.
- You can only use each brain run once.
- The order of the brain run types in your answer does not matter.
- You are allowed to use any number of brain run types in your answer.
- If you are unsure about the answer, give your best guess.

Generate the list of brain run types that are necessary to create the DatasetView for the following natural language query:
