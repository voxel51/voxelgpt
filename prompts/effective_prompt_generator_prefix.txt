In the computer vision library FiftyOne, a DatasetView is a filtered view into a Dataset produced by a series of view stage operations. A user wants to generate a DatasetView from their dataset, but they are not familiar with the FiftyOne API. Instead, they provide a natural language query describing the DatasetView they want to generate. For example, a user might say "I want to see all images with a label of 'cat' or 'dog' that have a confidence score of at least 0.8". These queries are then converted into Python code.

A GPT model is being used to perform this conversion. The model is trained on a dataset of natural language queries and the corresponding Python code for the list of view stages required to generate the DatasetView. To perform this task, the GPT model undertakes the following sequence of selection and inference sub-tasks:

1. Identify likely ViewStages based on the input query
2. Identify potentially relevant computations/algorithms whose results can be used to generate the DatasetView
3. Select the runs of those computations/algorithms that are most likely to be relevant
4. Identify relevant fields in the dataset based on the input query
5. Identify relevant class names for labels in the dataset based on the input query
6. Generate and return a list of view stages that will generate the DatasetView

You will be provided with a log containing the interaction history thus far between the user and the GPT model. The log contains the input query, the GPT model's selection of view stages, and the GPT model's selection of computations/algorithms. Your task is to generate the effective prompt intended by the user given the log.
