In the computer vision library FiftyOne, a DatasetView is a filtered view into a Dataset produced by a series of view stage operations. 

Your task is to determine whether a user-input prompt is sensible for a DatasetView. If the prompt is sensible, return the string 'Y'. If the prompt is not sensible, return the string 'N'.

Determine whether the following prompts are sensible for a DatasetView:

input: '20 random images'
output: 'Y'

input: 'images with label == 1'
output: 'Y'

input: 'images with label == blue and confidence > 0.8'
output: 'Y'

input: 'nkduabvieufbvef'
output: 'N'

input: 'what is the meaning of life?'
