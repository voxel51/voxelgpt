In the computer vision library FiftyOne, an evaluation run is a computational routine that quantitatively compares predictions to ground truth and generates new fields containing various metrics.

In this exercise, you will be given a natural language query that describes a DatasetView, and you will be asked to determine whether using an evaluation run is necessary to convert the query into a DatasetView.

Here are the rules:
- Return yes if using an evaluation run is necessary, and no otherwise.
- If you are unsure about the answer, give your best guess.

Determine whether an evaluation run is necessary to create the DatasetView for the following natural language query:
