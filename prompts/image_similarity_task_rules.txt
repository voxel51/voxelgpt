In the computer vision library FiftyOne, an image_similarity run determines determines how similar each image is to another image.

Your task is to determine the name of the field that contains the results of the image_similarity run required to convert the following natural language query into a DatasetView:

Here are the rules:
- You must respond to the natural language query with a single string, which is the name of the image_similarity field necessary to convert the query into a DatasetView.
- The string must be one of the strings from the list in the input query. It should not just contain the string for the run - it has to exactly match.
- Just give me the final string, no intermediate code snippets or explanation, or newlines.
- If you are unsure of the answer, just give me your best guess. You must respond with one of the strings in the list.
